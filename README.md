Project Title:

Project Description:
Project Description: Our project will utilize the camera on the OpenMV H7 to play "Rock, Paper, Scissors" against a human opponent. The AI will first randomly pick either Rock, Paper, or Scissors then it will detect what choice the human made using its camera and decide whether the human won or lost.

Key Objectives:
- Image Classification: Be able to differentiate between rock, paper and scissor based on the photo took from the camera attached to the OpenMV Cam H7
- Compare different models to look at inference, CPU, GPU usage, etc. to determine which model is the most efficient for OpenMV Cam H7
- Be able to take data from previous games, pick a move that has the highest probability of winning.

Technology Stack:
Openmv microcontoller, MobileNet-V1, EfficientNet-B4, MobileNet-V3, Laptop for SPI communication interface

Expected Outcomes:
- Show statistical comparison betweeen different models 
- Interactive system that can simultaneously take input from the previous games and make changes based on given (fed) data (machine learning)


Timeline:
Week 1 (11/11 - 11/15): Create models to distinguish between "Rock", "Paper", and "Scissors".
Week 2 (11/18 - 11/22): Create prediction algorithim to determine what choice the opponent will make based on prior games.
Post Thanksgiving (11/25 - 11/29): Test the full design with the camera and have it play games. Collect metrics on different models and their usages.
